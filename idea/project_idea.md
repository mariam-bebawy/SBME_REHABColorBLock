***how to use the app***  
- specify number of clothing items (n = 2)  
- take/upload pictures of clothing items  
- app determines if colours are a good match

***how to implement the app***  
- read img as HSV / as RGB then convert to HSV  
- object detection for clothing item  
- color detection for object  
- using H determine the colour matching percentage based on colour theory

#### PPT PRESENTATION  

***legally blind***
* color blindness is a condition that affects how you see colors with a lot of types present  
* most well-known type is represented in the ability to not not distinguish between red and green  
* 2-types of cells detect light; rods and cones &rarr; rods distinguishes between light and dark &rarr; cones distinguish color and detail  
* symptoms of color blindness are so mild they may go unnoticed  
* "if you've never seen color, how can you tell you have a problem with colors?"  
* "you don't know that you don't know" ==> gahel b gahlo
